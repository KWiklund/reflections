More git stuff.

Added new file as untracked  

The staging area is intermediate between the working directory and the repo.
Having it allows one to selectively track particular files for a commit, or make
changes prior to a commit.

We can use the staging area to examine staged changes.  Going through the changes allows us to verify that only a single
logical change is made per commit.  Other logical changes can be withheld for subsequent commits.
